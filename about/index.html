    My professional journey spans over 10 years, exploring diverse realms within sustainable agriculture and biosourced materials. With a Ph.D. in Wood Engineering and Biosourced Materials from Université Laval, my expertise lies in sustainable soil fertility management, biomass refining, and lignin valorization.
    <br/><br/>
   Currently, I contribute my skills as a researcher at Biopterre, focusing on the in vitro multiplication of carnivorous plants, the valorization of cannabis residue extracts for the biological control of soil fungi, and the isolation and characterization of lignins from agricultural residues. My work also extends
    to the production of nanoparticles and innovative applications in the field of intelligent agriculture. Beyond the laboratory, I apply my skills in statistical modeling, using tools like R, SAS, and others to derive valuable insights from complex agricultural data.,

    An autonomous and dynamic professional, I've honed my communication skills through various teaching roles, including aiding in courses like "Chimie de bois" and "Problèmes forestiers et sylviculture en région tropicale." This academic background positions me as a versatile and driven contributor to sustainable agricultural practices.

    Outside of my academic pursuits, I foster a deep passion for languages – not just the programming kind. Fluent in French and English, I find joy in bridging gaps through effective communication. My commitment to sustainable practices extends beyond the professional realm, as showcased through my involvement in the Association des Béninois de Québec.

    With a knack for problem-solving and a love for emerging technologies, I find parallels between my affinity for programming (favoring C++) and my research endeavors. Just as C++ is the language I gravitate towards in coding, it's also the language that resonates with the core of my agricultural research.
    <br/><br/>
    In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I indulge in the artistic realm with over 10 years of experience in musical exploration. Specializing in guitar, piano, and musical arrangement, this creative outlet complements my analytical mindset, adding a harmonious touch to my multifaceted profile.
